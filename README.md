## Theme:

Long Haul is a minimal jekyll theme built with COMPASS / SASS / SUSY and focuses on long form blog posts. It is meant to be used as a starting point for a jekyll blog/website.

If you really enjoy Long Haul and want to give me credit somewhere on the internet send or tweet out your experience with Long Haul and tag me [@brianmaierjr](https://twitter.com/brianmaierjr).
