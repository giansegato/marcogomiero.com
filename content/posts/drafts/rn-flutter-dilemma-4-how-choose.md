Welcome to the fourth and last part of this article series about React Native and Flutter. 

In the first episode, we have introduced the two frameworks with some history and with a comparison between the languages that they use. 

> [Flutter or React Native, a cross-platform dilemma - Introduction - (Part 1)](http://marcogomiero.com/posts/2019/rn-flutter-dilemma-1-intro/)

In the seconde episode, we have talked about User Interfaces and how to build them.

In the third episode we went deeper under the hoods to understand how things work.

And now it's time to wrap things up by trying to understand how to choose the right framework for you.



<!-- 

The bonus is the presentation and the talk 

Crossplatform is not bad but... IS NOT better than native It’s a choice with compromises based on specific situation If trouble became higher than benefits,make a step back.

Right now, React Native is more stable and solid Flutter is the future

If Google does not drop it 🙏
Better performance that other framework
Dart is a more modern language

Flutter for web
Desktop support

<!-- Make a wrap about everything. Talk about what to use right know. Talk about choices of cross platform. Talk about the new paradigm that these frameworks has introduced.  -->

<!-- 
Faster development. You deal with both iOS and Android at the same time.
Consistency between platforms. Users from both OSs get the same experience.
Lower costs. Reusable code, quick development, and smaller teams make for significant cost savings.
A single codebase. Having a single source of truth makes it easier to update the app when required.
