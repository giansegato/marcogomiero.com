<!-- Make a wrap about everything. Talk about what to use right know. Talk about choices of cross platform. Talk about the new paradigm that these frameworks has introduced.  -->

<!-- 
Faster development. You deal with both iOS and Android at the same time.
Consistency between platforms. Users from both OSs get the same experience.
Lower costs. Reusable code, quick development, and smaller teams make for significant cost savings.
A single codebase. Having a single source of truth makes it easier to update the app when required.
