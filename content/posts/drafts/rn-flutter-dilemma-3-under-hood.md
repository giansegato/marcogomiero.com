Welcome to the third part of this article series about React Native and Flutter. In the latest episode we have talked about User Interfaces and how to build it in the two frameworks. In this article we'll go deeper under the hoods to understand how things works. 

<!-- say that this will be a simple panoramic to understand how it works at high level, not covering all the deep things -->

If you have lost the previous articles, I suggest you to read them before moving on.
