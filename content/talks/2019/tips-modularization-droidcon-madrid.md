### [droidcon Madrid 19](https://www.madrid.droidcon.com/schedule)

## Abstract:
Nowadays, App modularization is a technique largely adopted that gives lots of advantages. But how to approach it?
This talk will not focus on the pro and cons of modularization but instead on the approach and the process to achieve it. In particular, I want to share the approach that I followed to modularize an existing application and a new one. I want also to share the failures and all the struggles that came in my head while approaching the process.
