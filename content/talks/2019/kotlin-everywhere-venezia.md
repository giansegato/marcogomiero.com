### [GDG Venezia](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/GDG-Venezia/events/265665209/)

## Abstract:
In this talk, we will see how it's possible to create a mobile application for Android and iOs that share some code (for example business logic, network, etc.) using Kotlin Platform. We will show a real application that we have built for this talk, i.e. a showcase app for the GDG Venezia.

We will show also how it's possible to create a backend for this app by of course using Kotlin!

This talk has been done in collaboration with [Andrea Maglie](http://www.andreamaglie.com/) that I thank
