Friends Tournament is a simple application that will help you to manage and organize tournaments with your friends. You can use it to generate videogames tournament, sports tournament, board games tournament, whatever type of tournament do you want. All you need to do is to provide the number of players, the number of matches and the numbers of player that can play at the same time.</description></item></channel></rss>
