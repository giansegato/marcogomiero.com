      <description>These days you have certainly heard about cross-platform mobile development, in particular about the &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; React Native and the &amp;ldquo;freshman&amp;rdquo; Flutter.
Today, I want to start a series of articles to understand the two frameworks. In particular, I want to describe their differences, their weaknesses, their strength&amp;hellip; so, all you need to know to help your choice.
In this article, I want to introduce the two frameworks with a historical overview and an analysis of the languages that they use.</description>

      <title>How I take note at conferences</title>

      <description>Today I want to share my setup of note-taking that I use during conferences.

That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.</description>
