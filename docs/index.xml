      <title>How I take note at conferences</title>

      <description>Today I want to share my setup of note-taking that I use during conferences.
Unfortunately, I’m not the guy able to take the beautiful, colorful sketchnotes that you can see on Twitter. That’s because I have never been able to draw, put colors and do manual graphics stuff in an orderly manner. My notes on paper would be colorless and cryptic. Moreover, I like the idea to have in one place, all the information regarding the talk that I watched, for example, link to the slides, photo, video, etc.</description>

      <description>You have just built an awesome Android library but you don’t know how to publish it? You are in the right place; in this article, I will explain to you the process that I use to publish my two libraries.
First of all, let’s assume that you have already developed your Android library, so you have a library module in Android Studio.
An example of a library module
The library will be published to *jCenter, *a Maven repository hosted by bintray.</description>

      <description>The recent revamp of the Material Design has introduced new beautiful items, for example, the Bottom App Bar.
Image from Material Design Guidelines
With Flutter is super easy to implement like shown in the official documentation. However, for me, the tricky part is to combine it with swipeable tabs so, in this article, I’ll explain all the steps that I’ve followed to obtain it.
Here’s a spoiler of the final result:</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago I released a new version of the RSS Parser Library and I talked about the update in a blog post.
 RSS Parser 2.0: bye bye Async Task, welcome Coroutines This update brought a huge change in the infrastructure of the library. SPOILER: Kotlin and coroutines. Today, in this post I want to talk about the transition process and all the decisions that I have made to develop this new version.</description>

      <description>Finally, I found some time to sit down and work on my library RSS Parser. Before starting to describe all the cool stuff that I’ve introduced with this update, I want to thank you all for the support. In fact this year, the library exceeded 100 stars on Github, that seems a little goal but it means a lot to me.
I wrote this library back in 2016 and now in 2018, the code was “ugly” compared to all the coolest stuff provided by Kotlin.</description>
