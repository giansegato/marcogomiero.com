<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap" align="justify">T</span></p><p align="justify">oday I've released a new version of the Android library RSS-Parser</p>

<p align="justify"> This library allows you to easily download an (or multiple) RSS Feed in order to display it in your application. If you don't know RSS-Parser, you can give a look to the <a href="http://www.marcogomiero.com/blog/rss-parser-library/" target="blank">blog post</a> dedicated to it. In that post I'll give also some tip about the library usage. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Starting from today you can get also the categories of the article, like shown in the screen below.</p>

<ul>

<li> <a href = "https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser/blob/master/RSS%20Parser.apk">Click here to download the app.</a> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">Thatâ€™s all! Please let me know if you notice any bug or if you have any advice that can improve this library.</p>
